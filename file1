This GitHub Actions workflow file, named Terraform Workflow 1, automates the process of managing infrastructure using Terraform when changes are pushed to the main branch or a pull request (PR) is created targeting the main branch.

Breakdown of the Workflow
1. Trigger Events
The workflow runs on:

Push to main branch
Pull requests targeting main
2. Permissions
The workflow grants the following permissions:

id-token: write â†’ Required for authentication with AWS
contents: write â†’ Allows modifying and pushing updates to the repository
pull-requests: write â†’ Allows updating PRs with comments or commits
3. Jobs
Job: terraform
Runs on Ubuntu-latest and executes a series of steps.

Steps in the Job
Step 1: Checkout Code
Uses the actions/checkout@v3 action to clone the repository.
Step 2: Configure AWS Credentials
Uses aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v1 to set up AWS authentication.
Fetches AWS credentials from GitHub secrets (AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY).
Sets the AWS region to us-east-1.
Step 3: Setup Terraform
Uses hashicorp/setup-terraform@v1 to install Terraform v1.0.0.
Step 4: Install terraform-docs
Downloads and installs terraform-docs (v0.16.0), a tool for generating Terraform documentation.
Step 5: Initialize Terraform
Runs terraform init -reconfigure to initialize Terraform and configure backend settings.
Step 6: Terraform Plan
Runs terraform plan -lock=false -out=plan.tfplan to generate an execution plan and save it to plan.tfplan.
Step 7: Generate Terraform Documentation
Uses terraform-docs markdown . > README.md to generate documentation from Terraform files and update the README.md.
Runs only on push or pull request events.
Step 8: Commit and Push Terraform Docs
Configures Git settings for github-actions[bot].
Adds README.md and plan.tfplan to Git.
Commits the changes with the message "Update Terraform Docs" (skips commit if no changes).
Pushes changes to the current branch.
Step 9: Apply Terraform Configuration (Only on Merge to main)
If the workflow was triggered by a push to main, it applies the Terraform plan (terraform apply -auto-approve -lock=false plan.tfplan).
This ensures infrastructure changes are deployed only after merging.
Summary
Validates and plans Terraform changes on PRs.
Applies Terraform changes automatically when merged into main.
Generates and updates Terraform documentation.
Commits Terraform documentation changes back to the repository.
This workflow ensures a structured and automated Terraform deployment process. ðŸš€
